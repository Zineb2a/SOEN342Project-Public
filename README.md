# **Gym Management System** - Comprehensive Fitness Organization Management Solution

## üìñ **Project Overview**
The Gym Management System is a software application designed to streamline the operations of a fitness organization. It enables administrators, instructors, and clients to manage schedules, bookings, lessons, and offerings seamlessly. The system also supports legal guardians for minor clients and ensures efficient organization through role-based management.

This project was built using **Java (JPA + Hibernate)**, **MySQL**, and **UML design principles**, showcasing strong proficiency in database integration, object-oriented programming, and system design.

## üì¶ **Installation & Setup**

### **Requirements:**
- JDK 17 or higher
- MySQL 8.x or higher
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)
- Hibernate and JPA dependencies (included in `pom.xml`)

### **Steps:**

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gym-management-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd gym-management-system
   ```

3. Set up your database:
   - Create a new MySQL database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE gym_management;
     ```
   - Configure the `application.properties` or `hibernate.cfg.xml` file with your database credentials:
     ```plaintext
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/gym_management
     spring.datasource.username=your-username
     spring.datasource.password=your-password
     ```

4. Run the application:
   - Use your IDE to execute the `ApplicationMain` class or:
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```

5. Access the application:
   - For CLI-based interface: Follow the menu prompts.
   - For GUI (if implemented): Run the Swing-based admin console.
